# üêç Command-Line Tic-Tac-Toe Game ‚ùå‚≠ï

A simple, two-player command-line implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, built in Python.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Colored Marks:** Uses the **`termcolor`** library to display 'X' (red) and 'O' (green) on the board for better visual clarity.
* **Clear Board Display:** A clean, easy-to-read board is printed after every move.
* **Input Validation:** Robust input handling ensures players enter valid row and column numbers (0-2) and prevents moves on spots that are already taken.
* **Win/Tie Detection:** Automatically checks for all possible win conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals) and announces a winner or a draw (full board).

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

This project relies on the **`termcolor`** library for colored output. You must install it using pip:

```bash
pip install termcolor
````

### Execution

1.  Clone this repository or ensure the `tic_tac_toe.py` file is saved locally.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4.  Run the game using the Python interpreter:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

### Gameplay

  * The game starts with **Player X** (displayed in red).
  * Players take turns entering the **row** and **column** (values from 0 to 2) where they wish to place their mark.
  * The board is updated and printed after each valid move.
  * The game ends when a player achieves three in a row or the board is full.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

The entire game logic is contained within a single file:
